//Even though the code is simple, it’s not immediately obvious how it works. We have to dig into details to pick out steps of processing it does and remember them for further code analysis – we just have to recall a real business code with much longer methods.

//The above method can be called like this:

int sum = sumBestBefore("1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10", 10, 3);
System.out.println("Sum of best 3: " + sum);
// prints: Sum of best 3: 27
