//Original code with lots of conditional logic.
//Lets say there is a method that calculates insurance costs based on a person's income:
public double CalculateInsurance(double income)
{
  if (income <= 100000)
  {
    return income*0.365;
  } else if (income <= 300000)
  {
    return (income-100000)*0.2 + 35600;
  } else if (income <= 600000)
  {
    return (income - 300000)*0.1 + 76500;
  } else
  {
    return (income - 600000)*0.02 + 105600;
  }
}

/** Let's analyze above example. Here we see the four "income bands widths", separated into four calculation strategies. In general, the following is a formula:

i.e. (income - adjustment) * weight + constant
The goal is to provide separate classes to calculate each strategy, and transform the original class to make it more transparent. **/
